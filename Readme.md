In the root meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana, stem cells divide asymmetrically for the self renewal and generation of new cells for the root development. The quiescent centre (QC) cells are embedded in the stem cells. These QC cells manage a ?ne balance to maintain the individual characteristics of the surrounding cells and repress their di?erentiation. The WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) is one of the master regulators of distal root stem cells. The WOX5 protein is expressed in the QC and moves from to the columella stem cells to keep them undi?erentiated. However, the targetgenesofWOX5arestillunknown. WeshowthedirecttargetsofWOX5, identify the trancriptomic signature of QC, CSC and CRC and identify the relationship of these cell types to WOX5 in this thesis.
